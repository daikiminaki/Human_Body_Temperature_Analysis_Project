# Human_Body_Temperature_Analysis_Project
*Analyze a dataset of human body temperatures and employ the concepts of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance.

#### Language: Python
 
### Problem
The mean normal body temperature was held to be 37∘C or 98.6∘F for more than 120 years since it was first conceptualized and reported by Carl Wunderlich in a famous 1868 book. But, is this value statistically correct?
 
### Approach
Analyze a dataset of human body temperatures and employ the concepts of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance.
